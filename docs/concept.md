# OVEN Concept

- **OVEN**

  - Multiple device clusters can be networked to a dedicated server for central coordination, production scheduling, historical archiving, and facility alerts to manage multiple independent processes to achieve some business or organizational goal
  - This is referred to as **OVEN** which stands for _Organized Versatile Embedded Network_
  - **Example:** A distributed recycling and manufacturing system where multiple microcomputers, each managing different BATCH nodes (e.g., plastic upcycling, intermediate conveyor systems, quality control analysis, packaging and labelling, etc.), are connected to a central server to optimize production.
